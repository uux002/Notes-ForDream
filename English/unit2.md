#### Grammar

**Present simple and present continuous**

We use the present simple for:

- facts and truths
- habits
- permanent situations

We often use adverbs of frequency and time expressions like **every day, once a week, on Fridays.**

**I check **my email every day. (regular activity)

**Sheryl works** at the bank. (permanent situation)



We use the present continuous for:

- things that are happening now - at the time we are speaking,
- temporary situations
- activities that are in progress

We often use time expressions like **at the moment, today, this week.**

Just a minute. **I'm checking** my email. (now)

She usually works in London, but **she's working** from home this week. (Temporary situation)

**I'm studying** Economics. (activity in progress)



##### Form - Positive

The present simple has the same form as the infinitive without 'to' for I, you, we and they. for he, she and it, we add -s or -es to the infinitive.

They **live** in Rome.

Julian **starts** work at nice o'clock and **finishes** at five.



The present continuous for I is **subject + am + verb-ing** For you, we and they: **subject + are + verb-ing**. For he, she, it: **subject + is + verb-ing**. We usually use contractions (I'm, he's, they're, etc.) when we are speaking.
